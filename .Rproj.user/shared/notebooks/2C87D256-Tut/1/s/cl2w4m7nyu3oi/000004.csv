# In the United States, the main dietary source of trans fats is partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, previously used in many commercially prepared foods. Consuming trans fats may adversely affect cholesterol levels in the body and may contribute to the risk of atherosclerosis. Because of this, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has banned the use of trans fats in prepared foods.
